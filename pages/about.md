Have you ever made up a special, spack specific term, like "spackage"?
Or have you wondered about specific terms in the spack jargon like "spec" or "build cache?"
This is a place you can read about each one, or you can more generally write them all
down in one place! Some terms are for fun like "spackage" and some are considered
spack terminology like "spec." The following symbols can help:

 - ⭐️ indicates that you've found a core spack term!
 - 😆 indicates that you've found a fun spack term!

With the spack encyclopedia we can have a little fun, and celebrate
spack!
